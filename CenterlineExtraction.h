/******************************************************************************
* Extracts centerlines from a binary image (data: width x height),
* prunes the centerline graph by removing segments smaller than max_segment_length.
* The segments are smoothed if smoothing_span is larger than 0. The x and y coordinates of all
* points are returned in the linear arrays out_x and out_y. The start
* indices of all segments is given in out_idx, where the last index is the total
* number of points (out_idx[num_segs]). The number of segments is returned by the
* function. Data should not contain any object pixels along the boundary of the image. 
* The memory for out_x, out_y, and out_idx is allocated by the function. 
* The caller is responsible for deleteting this memory!
